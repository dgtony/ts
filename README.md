# TS - timestamp utility
Tiny utility, that solves (at least for me) couple of annoying issues with Unix timestamps.

Woohoo, you don't need online-converters or Python interpreter running just to check out current timestamp anymore! Well, in most cases.

## Usage
There are just two things this utlity is capable of:

* print current Unix timestamp (no arguments):

```
# ts
Current timestamp: 1529618183
```

* parse given timestamp:

```
# ts 1529618183
1529618183 => 2018-06-21 21:56:23 UTC
```
